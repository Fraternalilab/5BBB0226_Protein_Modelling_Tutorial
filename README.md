## Content

`ARAF_HUMAN_PK.fasta`: FASTA sequence of the query protein (Protein kinase domain of ARAF_HUMAN). Downloaded from UniProt.

`Automated_Mode_Temp=6q0j.pdb`: Automated mode model generated by SWISS-MODEL of the query protein, using 6q0j as the template. PDB format.

`BLAST_aligned_seq_Top10.fasta`: Top 10 templates in the BLAST search (against PDB) of the query protein. Amino acid sequences of the aligned templates in fasta format.

`BLAST_hit_table_Top100.txt`: The top 100 templates in the BLAST search (against PDB) of the query protein. BLAST search statistics in table format.

`BLAST_search_strategy.asn`: BLAST search strategy downloaded (you can use this as input to BLAST if the search is to be repeated)

`Template_6N0P.fasta`: FASTA sequence of 6n0p as a template to model the query protein. 

`Template_6N0P.pdb`: PDB structure of 6n0p as a template to model the query protein.
